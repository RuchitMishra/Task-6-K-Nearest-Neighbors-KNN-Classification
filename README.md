# Task-6-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Classification
#Objective Preprocess and normalize the dataset Train KNN classifiers with different values of K Evaluate the model using accuracy and confusion matrix Visualize decision boundaries in 2D using petal features

#Tools Used Python Pandas, NumPy Scikit-learn: KNN, preprocessing, metrics Matplotlib, Seaborn

#How to Run Make sure Iris.csv is in your project folder. Copy the Python code into a Jupyter Notebook or .py file. Run the script and follow the output.

#Highlights K Value Tuning: Loops through K = 1 to 10 and finds the best value. Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy scores and confusion matrix. Decision Boundary: Visualization using only PetalLength & PetalWidth to show KNN's classification regions.

#Decision Boundary: The boundary plot helps visualize how the classifier distinguishes between different classes using two features.
